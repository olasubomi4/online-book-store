Quantum bits, a.k.a. qubits, can make it possible to solve problems that would otherwise be intractable with current computing technology.\r\n\r\nDancing with Qubits is a quantum computing textbook that starts with an overview of why quantum computing is so different from classical computing and describes several industry use cases where it can have a major impact. From there it moves on to a fuller description of classical computing and the mathematical underpinnings necessary to understand such concepts as superposition, entanglement, and interference. Next up is circuits and algorithms, both basic and more sophisticated. It then nicely moves on to provide a survey of the physics and engineering ideas behind how quantum computing hardware is built. Finally, the book looks to the future and gives you guidance on understanding how further developments will affect you.\r\n\r\nReally understanding quantum computing requires a lot of math, and this book doesn\'t shy away from the necessary math concepts you\'ll need.

This belief is partly as a result of the growing rise in the damage that hackers are causing to computer systems and business organizations. However, this audiobook aims to counter that belief. Hacking is a broad term that is used to describe the work of the ethical hacker and the black hat hacker.\r\n\r\nThis audiobook provides a comprehensive explanation of the work of an ethical hacker. It starts by explaining the term \"hacking\" and the different types of hacking. Ethical hacking is a type of hacking, and the ethical hacker is someone who is versatile in hacking but uses his or her knowledge for the benefit of the business organization or the individual. Ethical hacking is observed from the three major aspects of hacking:\r\n\r\n    The pre-attack stage\r\n    Attack stage\r\n    Penetration testing\r\n\r\nThe pre-attack stage involves footprinting, enumerations, and scanning, while the attack stage covers password cracking, keyloggers and spyware, threats and vulnerability scanning, and steganography. \r\n\r\nPenetration testing is a vital aspect of ethical hacking. During testing, the ethical hacker simulates the ways intruders gain access to a company\'s system. The audiobook explains the different ways in which it is used and the countermeasures an ethical hacker can use to foil the work of the hacker.\r\n\r\nIf you’re interested in being an ethical hacker, or are just curious about the field of hacking, then this audiobook is for you!
